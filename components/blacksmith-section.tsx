              At the Blacksmith, players can forge, enhance, and merge gear to create more powerful equipment tailored
              to their strategy. Weapons can be upgraded to deal more damage, armor reinforced to withstand brutal
              waves, and enhancements fused to unlock rare abilities. Each improvement directly boosts key stats like
              Attack, Defense, Speed, and HPâ€”shaping the odds in battles and scavenging runs. Want to push your luck
              deeper into the wasteland? You'll need your gear sharpened, hardened, and customized.
